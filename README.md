# ECG Classification Project

This project involves the classification of ECG (Electrocardiogram) readings to determine whether they are normal or abnormal. The dataset consists of rows, each representing a complete ECG of a patient with 140 data points (readings). The target variable is a categorical variable with values 0 or 1, indicating whether the ECG is normal (0) or abnormal (1).
